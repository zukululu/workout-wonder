## Description
Workout Wonder is an online application that allows the users to create an account and store a workout routine. It utilizes 
Express and MongoDB that is hosted on mLab. Mongoose is used to speak to the database, and Handlebars renders the view. I 
decided on this application because I was switching workout routines and couldn't find any quick methods online, so here we 
are.
